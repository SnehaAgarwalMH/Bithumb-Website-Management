# CI/CD Process

This project follows a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process to ensure smooth development and deployment of automation scripts for managing the Binance website.

## Workflow

Our CI/CD workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Push to Main:** CI/CD is triggered automatically when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

2. **Set Up Environment:** The workflow sets up the necessary environment, including Java and Selenium.

3. **Build and Test:** The script is built and tested to ensure it meets quality standards.

4. **Deployment:** In this example, deployment steps are not included. However, in a real-world scenario, you might deploy the scripts to a server or a container.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration ensures that code changes are automatically built, tested, and validated as part of the development process. Any issues or errors are caught early in the development cycle.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment automates the deployment process, making it easier to release updates and changes to production environments.

## GitHub Actions

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that allows you to define workflows directly in your GitHub repository.

For details on how to set up and customize GitHub Actions for your project, refer to the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

Please note that the provided CI/CD configuration in the `dev-binance-automation.yaml` file is a basic example. You should customize it according to your project's specific needs and deployment requirements.

For any questions or assistance related to CI/CD, please reach out to our team.
